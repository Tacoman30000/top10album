        <p2a>MUSIC!!!</p2a>

        <p4><br>Different music has different ways of affecting the mind. Happy music can makes us happy, sad music can make us sad. Either way its safe to say music can help us through difficult times.</p4>
        <p5><br>Everyone has different taste in music, they hace different ways of helping as well...</p5>
        <p6><br>Scientificaly music can actualy use almost every part of the brain, so its not just that you like the song, your brain physicaly reacts more to music!<br></p6>

        <p><br><br></p><p7>Is there a type of music that can help me focus?</p7></p>
        <p8>Listen to whatever you like but some genres are proven to improve your focus and lower your stress.</p8>
        <p9><br>genres such as jazz, classical and most often music without vocals can help focus and help relax</p9>
        <p10><br> of course, not everyone relaxes to these but its statisticly the best<br></p10>
